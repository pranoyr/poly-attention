## Poly Attention

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02422">Poly-Attention</a>, a general scheme for higher-order self-attention

## Install

```bash
$ pip install poly-attention
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from poly_attention import PolyAttention

attn = PolyAttention(
    dim = 512,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64,
    causal = False
)

tokens = torch.randn(1, 1024, 512)

out = attn(tokens) # (1, 1024, 512)
```

A Vision Transformer based on Poly-Attention

```python
import torch
from poly_attention import PolyViT

vit = PolyViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    order = 2 # standard poly attention order 2
)

images = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = vit(images) # (1, 1000)
```
